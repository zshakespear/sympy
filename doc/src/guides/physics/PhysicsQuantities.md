I want this page to:
    - Explain how to use quantities in problem-solving
    - List the units that are already available in the package. Explain how prefixes can be built up from base units
    - Explain how to define your own units in problem solving. Include an invitation to contribute units that haven't been developed yet.

Now onto Outlining

# How to Use Quantities and Units
- What are Quantities?
    - I'm pretty sure this is somewhere else in the documentation. Include a link then.
- The benefits of using Quantities in your calculations:
    - Let the computer simplify your units
    - Spend less time doing unit conversions
- Include code snippets that show how to include Quantities in some of the basic use cases already included in the documentation
    - Show how to use solveset and convert_to to yield a solution in the desired units

# Defining Your Own Units

- Include code snippets for how to import dimensions
- The role of Dimensions in Quantities
- Defining transformations to other units

# Predefined Units

- Provide code snippets for how to import
- List of units, grouped roughly according to how they are in the module
- List of prefixes that can be used to extend the base units.
